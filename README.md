Part 1 Setup

4. To run the programs on two different devices
   Connect the devices using an ethernet cable.
   To establish that they are connected correctly we did the following:
   Go to Control Panel> Network and Internet> Network and Sharing Center> Change adapter settings
   Check which ethernet is connected to the cable and go to Properties, check the Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) box > properties > use the following IP address.
   Set the IP address as 192.168.1.1 and subnet mask 255.255.255.0 ( set the other one as 192.168.1.2 and same subnet mask )
   In terminal, type ping 192.168.1.1 to check whether they are connected.
